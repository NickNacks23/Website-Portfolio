# Portfolio Website
This is my personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This website showcases my background, skills, interests, and the projects I am developing as a Front-End Developer and Computer Science major at Cal Poly Pomona

**Live Site:** https://nicknacks23.github.io/Website-Portfolio/

# Overview
This is a fully responsive website that includes the following sections:
- Home/Hero: An introduction and navigation bar
- About Me: This includes my background, skills, experience, and education
- Interests: This focuses on the areas such as Web Development, UI/UX Design, and Front-End Development
- Portfolio: This is a project gallery that has hover effects with GitHub links
- Contact: Shows an email form connected to Google Sheets along with my social links

# Objective
The reason I created this portfolio was to make a personal space where I am able to showcase my growth as a developer.
My main goals include:
- Producing a clean, responsive website that is reflective of my style and attention to the smallest details
- I am able to practice front-end development fundamentals such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- I learned how to structure and output a professional website through 'GitHub Pages'
- I can showcase projects that I have made, along with demonstrating my interests in UI/UX and responsive designs

As a whole, this project has helped me strengthen and deeper my understanding of my skills in layout design, animation, and accessibility while being able to create something that is unique to me
